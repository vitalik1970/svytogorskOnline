        <p>The goal of this project is to restore the former glory of the city of Svyatogorsk as one of the most beautiful places in Ukraine, called “Donetsk Switzerland”, located on the territory of the national natural park “Holy Mountains”, this is the northernmost city of the Donetsk region. It is rightfully considered the greenest among all cities in Ukraine. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Nature has created all the necessary conditions for recovery and treatment in Svyatogorsk. There are mountains, a river, and a forest here. These natural resources contribute to the creation of a unique climate at the resort. The chalk mountains serve as a natural barrier to cold winds. And in summer it is not so hot here due to the proximity of the river. Pine forests stretch for several kilometers, saturating the ionized air with phytoncides. It's good to breathe here. It is not surprising that diseases of the respiratory system, circulatory system, nervous system, etc. are successfully treated in Svyatogorsk. Even a simple stay here strengthens the body and improves metabolic processes.
        </p><br>
        <p>Until 2014, there were more than 100 children’s health camps in our city, including those operating year-round. Almost all large enterprises of the Donetsk region had their own such institutions in Svyatogorsk, especially the mines of Donetsk, Makeevka, Gorlovka, plants of Kramatorsk, Konstantinovka, Druzhkovka.</p>
        <p>A photograph from the 1980s has survived, which very clearly shows how popular recreation and recreation for children was in Syatogorsk. This photograph captures the moment the children were sent on vacation from the city of Kramatorsk.

        <p>There were three sanatoriums “Shakhtar”, “Holy Mountains” and “Solnechny” in the city, as well as a huge number of boarding houses, recreation centers and other health and recreation institutions.
        </p>
        <p>Svyatogorsk was heavily damaged during the hostilities in 2022; about 80% of the housing stock and infrastructure were destroyed. This is very sad, especially if you remember how popular our city was among the residents of Donbass!</p><br>
